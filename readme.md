This repository contains the implementation of a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task using the BERT model fine-tuned on the CoNLL-2003 dataset. The project demonstrates the use of transfer learning to achieve high performance in recognizing named entities such as Person, Organization, Location, and Miscellaneous categories.
